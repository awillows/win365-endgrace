- Clear the search box or press F5 to show all Cloud PCs again

#### Deprovisioning a Cloud PC

1. **Right-click** on a Cloud PC in the list (or select it and press **Delete**)
2. Select **"Deprovision Now (End Grace Period)"** from the context menu
   - This option is only enabled for Cloud PCs in grace period
   - The option appears grayed out for other Cloud PCs
3. A warning dialog will appear asking for confirmation

## Understanding Cloud PC Status

Common status values you may see:

- **provisioned**: Cloud PC is active and running
- **inGracePeriod**: Cloud PC is in grace period (user assignment removed, pending deprovision)
- **deprovisioning**: Cloud PC is being removed
- **provisionedWithWarnings**: Cloud PC is active but has warnings
- **notProvisioned**: Cloud PC has not been provisioned yet

## Grace Period Information

When a user license is removed or a Cloud PC is unassigned, it enters a grace period:

- **Duration**: Typically 7 days
- **Purpose**: Allows time to back up data or reassign the Cloud PC
- **During Grace**: The Cloud PC remains accessible but will be automatically deprovisioned when the grace period ends
- **End Grace Early**: Use this tool to deprovision immediately instead of waiting for automatic cleanup

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Deprovisioning a Cloud PC is a **permanent action** that cannot be undone. All data on the Cloud PC will be lost.

### Best Practices

1. **Always verify** the Cloud PC and user before deprovisioning
2. **Ensure data backup** has been completed if needed
3. **Confirm with users** that they no longer need access to the Cloud PC
4. **Use with caution** in production environments
5. **Test first** in a non-production tenant if possible

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: Cannot connect to Microsoft Graph

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you have the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK installed
- Check that your account has the necessary permissions
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting: `Disconnect-MgGraph` then run the script again
- Verify you're using the correct tenant

### No Cloud PCs Displayed

**Problem**: The list is empty but you know Cloud PCs exist

**Solutions**:
- Click the Refresh button
- Verify your account has permissions to view Cloud PCs
- Check that you're connected to the correct tenant
- Ensure Cloud PCs are Windows 365 Business (not Enterprise)

### Deprovision Option Grayed Out

**Problem**: Cannot select "Deprovision Now" option

**Expected Behavior**: This is by design. The option is only enabled for Cloud PCs in grace period. If a Cloud PC is not in grace, you cannot use this tool to deprovision it.

### API Errors

**Problem**: Error messages when trying to deprovision

**Solutions**:
- Verify your account has `CloudPC.ReadWrite.All` permissions
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure the Microsoft Graph API is accessible from your network
- Try refreshing your authentication token by restarting the application

## API Endpoints Used

This application uses the following Microsoft Graph API endpoints:

- `GET /deviceManagement/virtualEndpoint/cloudPCs` - List all Cloud PCs
- `POST /deviceManagement/virtualEndpoint/cloudPCs/{id}/endGracePeriod` - End grace period and deprovision

## Technical Details

### Requirements

- **PowerShell Version**: 5.1 or later
- **Modules**: Microsoft.Graph.Authentication, Microsoft.Graph.DeviceManagement.Actions
- **GUI Framework**: WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- **API**: Microsoft Graph Beta endpoint

### Architecture

The application is built using:
- **WPF/XAML** for the user interface
- **Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK** for API communication
- **ListView control** with custom styling for data presentation
- **Context menus** for action triggers

## License

This tool is provided as-is for managing Windows 365 Cloud PCs. Use at your own risk and always ensure you have proper backups before deprovisioning any Cloud PC.
